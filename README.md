# SoCo - *Resource Maximisation Planning System for Labs*

Our aim for this project is to create a resource allocation application for SoCo computer labs. The app will make use of resources available and be adaptable to new entries to create a working timetable for the Computing courses and the limited resources (Computer Lab rooms) whilst following a strict set of pre-defined constraints and restrictions.

The end vision of the project will be to have a application that will adapt to new entries and create the best layout of courses in a given week based on the strict restrictions and constraints.

As SoCo is a new project beginning in Semester 1, 2024. There is currently no content in the GitHub but will be structured and laid out as the project evolves.

## Technical constraints

### Reliability

- **Fault Tolerance**: In case of the server going down, client devices shutting down, and other cases. The program should have a save point every so often it can revert back to. This could be as simple as saving the point of time it is at somewhere and replacing it every so often.
- **Error Handing**: There should be specific case errors written when developing this application so the user/developer can understand what is being done incorrectly and doesn't leave them clueless as to why the program is not working.
- **Data Integrity**: There should not be changes to the data directly unless it is explicitly asked by the end-user (and even so with confirmation). The data should be changed via copying it, not changing it directly at the source.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: There should be a method of monitoring and logging functionalities to track system performance, identify issues proactively and faciliatate troubleshooting.

### Security

- **Access Control**: There should be a hierarchy of who can access certain parts of the program, and this should include any sensitive data and functionalities within the application.
- **Data Encryption**: Utilize encryption techniques to protect sensitive data from un-authorized tampering.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms to verify the identities of users and grant appropriate permissions based on their roles.
- **Secure Communication**: Ensure that data exchanged between the application and external systems is transmitted securely over encrypted channels, such as HTTPS or other secure formats.

### Safety

- **Code Review and Testing**: Conduct thorough code reviews and testing to identify and address security vulnerabilities, bugs, and logic errors that could potentially compromise the safety and reliability of the application. This may involve manual code reviews, automated static code analysis, and dynamic application security testing (DAST).
- **Data Privacy and Protection**: Implement measures to safeguard sensitive data collected and processed during the development process, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and confidential project docuemtns. This may include data anonymization, encryption, and access controls to protect against data breaches and un-authorized access.
- **Version Control and Change Management**: Utilize versioning control and change management, for example using pull requests when changes are made with a code review in place to ensure whatever the new addition is, is not going to compromise safety.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly review and update dependencies (e.g., libraries, frameworks, third-party components) used in the application to address security vulnerabilies and ensure compatibility with security patches and updates released by vendors.
- **Documentation and Training**: Provide comprehensive documentation and training materials to developers and other stakeholders on secure development practices, security guidelines, and incident response procedures to promote awareness and adherence to safety and security best practices throughout the development lifecycle.

### Other

- **Computiational Complexity**: Scheduling and timetabling is a computationally complex problem - as the number of classes and constraints increases, it takes exponentially more time to find an optimal solution. For the number of classes the system is required to schedule, it is infeasible to test all combinations of schedules. The system will need to use a more efficient approach to find a solution that is as close to optimal as possible in a reasonable time. 

## Project Resources

### Risk Management

Risk management involves identifying potential risks that could threaten the success of a project, assessing their likelihood and potential impact, and planning strategies to mitigate or avoid them. For the "School of Computing (SoCo) Resource Maximisation Planning System for Labs" project at the Australian National University (ANU), a structured approach to risk management is essential given the project's complexity and the diverse needs of its stakeholders. Here's a detailed risk management plan:

**Risk Identification**

- **Technical Challenges**: Development complexities related to scheduling algorithms and user interfaces.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Effective communication and engagement with all project stakeholders.
- **Data Accuracy and Completeness**: Dependence on precise and complete data for scheduling.
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Seamless integration with ANU's existing IT systems.
- **User Adoption**: Ensuring user transition and acceptance of the new system.
- **Regulatory and Policy Compliance**: Compliance with ANU policies and regulatory standards.
- **Budget and Resource Constraints**: Management of budgetary limitations and resource allocation.
- **Timeline Delays**: Potential delays impacting project milestones and delivery.
- **Scalability and Performance**: System's ability to accommodate growth and maintain efficiency.

**Risk Assessment**

- **Technical Challenges**: High likelihood; High impact.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Medium likelihood; High impact.
- **Data Accuracy and Completeness**: High likelihood; High impact.
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Medium likelihood; Medium impact.
- **User Adoption**: High likelihood; High impact.
- **Regulatory and Policy Compliance**: Low likelihood; High impact.
- **Budget and Resource Constraints**: Medium likelihood; Medium impact.
- **Timeline Delays**: High likelihood; High impact.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Medium likelihood; High impact.

**Risk Mitigation Strategies**

- **Technical Challenges**: Engage expert developers, conduct extensive testing, and implement phased rollouts.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Maintain regular updates, establish clear communication channels, and involve stakeholders in key decisions.
- **Data Accuracy and Completeness**: Implement stringent data validation protocols, regular data audits, and a system for reporting data discrepancies.
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Collaborate with IT departments early on to ensure compatibility and smooth integration.
- **User Adoption**: Offer comprehensive training, ongoing support, and detailed documentation.
- **Regulatory and Policy Compliance**: Conduct regular reviews of ANU policies, ensure development compliance, and integrate legal consultations.
- **Budget and Resource Constraints**: Allocate a contingency budget, regularly review financial and resource allocations.
- **Timeline Delays**: Adopt an Agile methodology to enhance adaptability and manage delays effectively.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Design with scalability in mind, conduct performance stress tests.

**Monitoring and Review**

A structured schedule will be implemented for ongoing risk monitoring, assessment of emerging risks, and evaluation of mitigation strategies. This will involve regular check-ins with the project team and stakeholders to ensure active and effective risk management throughout the project's lifecycle.

### Project costs

The only expected costs for the project would be for the hardware for the server (i.e. a computer). During development/prototyping a student’s computer could be used, and the final system is expected to run on computers provided by the School of Computing / university at no cost. There should be no need for domain name registration as the system is expected to run on the internal university network.

The other resources required is data about labs, rooms and enrollments, which have been provided by the client.

## Project NDA and IP status

The IP of the solution will remain the property of the students in the group, so long as the School of Computing is able to continue to use and modify the software freely.

## Problematisation Analysis

## Client's Vision and objectives

- **Efficiency**: To develop a system capable of creating the most efficient lab schedules, maximising the use of available resources.
- **Flexibility**: To accommodate a wide range of constraints and course requirements, ensuring the system's applicability across various teaching periods and evolving academic needs.
- **Usability**: To provide a user-friendly interface that allows staff to input constraints, view schedules, and make adjustments as needed.
- **Scalability**: To ensure the system can handle an increasing number of courses, labs, and constraints without a decrease in performance.

## Stakeholder Analysis

| Stakeholder | Reason | 
|--|--|
| Client | They are commissioning the system so that it can serve their needs in allocating labs to classes. | 
| School of Computing administrative staff | They may be using the system after it is complete to enter data about course enrolments, lab sizes, etc. |
| Courses.Course convenors | Need to provide information to the system/School about tutor numbers, and may also have other requirements that affect scheduling | 
| Students | Effective scheduling of classes has a number of benefits to students: Leads to fewer clashes, meaning students can attend more classes ; Ensures the tutor to student ratio is maintained, so students get enough support during classes. |
| Tutors | Effective scheduling of classes ensures that tutor to student ratios are not exceeded, making it easier for tutors to teach. |
| Other users of the buildings in scope | Effective scheduling means less room times are taken up by labs, allowing others to use the rooms for other purposes. |

## Handover process

As a starting project in Semester 1, 2024 we do not have an existing codebase or project to work from. So to allow the next generation of developers for this project, we will have a detailed explanation of the project, the backend, the frontend,
and how the logic and algorithm provides the solution to the problem that our client at the School of Computing wants solved.

As a project, we are coding using Java for the backend, Springboot to talk to the server, Firebase as our "current" file server (we are looking into more long term plans with a physical server on-campus), and React as our coding language for the frontend.
We plan to integrate all the above using an api to interface with the backend and to run the backend and server on the same device in the long run.

As for developing, you can find the relevant setup process in the docs/technical-reports folder on how to setup your IDE/environment in the way that our development team has done so.

There will be sufficient communication during a handover process between the prior team and the upcoming members to make sure that they understand and can reach out if there are any misunderstandings with the project.

However we plan to minimise as much confusion as possible with relevant comments in the code, documentation on the github repository, and FAQs if we get a sufficient amount of common mistakes that take place.
