We are keeping the reflection log as a Google Sheets for ease of writing them out as the tabling structure of markdown is finicky, and it is easier to move things around in a google sheets form.

[Reflection Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TmZKWuuxpqiZpOMa73VKO0U_JGO1ZUpUU4_eis5USIk/edit#gid=0)

Reflections sourced from Team Discussions, Team Meetings, Audits, and Actions made by the team.
