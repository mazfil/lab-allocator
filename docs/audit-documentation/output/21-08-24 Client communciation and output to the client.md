### Output for the client

What we have done for our client Belinda, is that we have demo's of the project that we have delivered during our team meetings every week with her.

We have communicated with her and have a user testing setup for the end of this week on the friday 23/08/2024. We will talk with some more School of Computing Admin staff
who are likely to be using our program in the future, and will collect some information and feedback on the project in the current state. We have also sent images
and supporting information to our client throughout the semester to update on what it looks like, what we are planning on doing, etc.

As stated in the README, this is high-level, and is only focusing on specific outputs that we deem necessary to report in a separate file. This is most likely not all the output of the project.
