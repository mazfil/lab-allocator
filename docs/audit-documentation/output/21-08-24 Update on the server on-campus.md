### Update on the On-Campus server.

We have worked with the School of Computing Facility team to get a development server that we have access to and are working on developing on.

We have been provided with a Debian based server that we can SSH into from anywhere on campus. This allows certain users from the team to access it and develop on it.

This also allows us to stress test and see if we need to have more resources allocated to it, or if we need to optimise it to run better on it.

We have also successfully run the frontend portion on the server and connected. However we are running into a special case where it won't work again if the developer
signs in again after disconnecting from the SSH login. We are working on a workaround, and if we cannot find something easy to fix it, we will reach out to the Facility team.

You can see Issue #86 on the communication logs.
