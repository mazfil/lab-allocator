We have made a lot of UI changes, some logic changes to the manage timetable, a lot of changes to the manage data page, the addition of logs to tell us and the user what is wrong, the addition of a generate with algorithm button on the dashboard, updates to the wiki in regards to the new manage data page, the completion of user testing with our client and stakeholders, docs/audit-documentation/meetings/user-testing/ for the file. We received a lot of feedback regarding that, and we will work through and implement as much as we can before audit, but we will likely be working on it over the next coming weeks as well.
