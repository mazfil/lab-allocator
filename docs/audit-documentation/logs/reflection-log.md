We are keeping the reflection log as a Google Sheets for ease of writing them out as the tabling structure of markdown is finicky, and it is easier to move things around in a google sheets form.

[Reflection Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TmZKWuuxpqiZpOMa73VKO0U_JGO1ZUpUU4_eis5USIk/edit#gid=0)

Reflections sourced from Team Discussions, Team Meetings, Audits, and Actions made by the team.

You can also find more decisions that are made in the Reflections Issue that was created for Semester 2, 2024. See ![Here](https://github.com/mazfil/lab-allocator/issues/92).

Updated and kept as a log by Rachel Cao and Edward Nivison
