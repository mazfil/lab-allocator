## Content from the meeting

### Feedback

- We should look at making the colours for the frontend have more contrast, and possibly make an option for users to change the colour scheme if it doesn't work for them.
- We should look at expanding the project output section on the landing page, this could possibly be adding some more words and images possibly to the landing page. Or making the README.md in the output folder have more prominent and easy to look at output. This is so they can see what we have outputted. Perhaps we could also link to important areas of our github that shows output, such as linking to issues that are closed, or we could look at adding a new label to show issues that are new this semester. Something like that could show our progress this semester.

### Shadow Team

- They have an updated landing page that is a bit more structured.
- They detail out what fighting style that they are doing for the project.
- They have a technical design document to define what the game is. How many teams are working on the project as well.

### Questions for the shadow team

- With all the different status's, how do you plan on showing the different status's visually so the user can see them clearly and distinctly from all the other status's?
- If this is mobile, are you in charge of the control scheme/layout, and how would it be developed so people can use all of your different attack styles, defense abilities, and movement between each state of the game.
- Would the game be a lot of stop and start mechanic, or would it be a continuous gameplay?

- There were more questions from Filip and Alex, but I haven't written them down.
