## Agenda:

Weekly agenda items:
- Go over the reflection logs, and ensure that there are sufficient progress being made on them. Make some reference to the comment that they are relevant to in the issue to show progress.
- Go over any decisions and log them as completed, implemented, or not started, they should all have issues to them, and should show progress.

Per meeting agenda:

- Can we talk about the WPP that is due today and also friday, whatever you have access to. Edward has a question about the anonymity of it (photos that are censored of personal information ok? instead of text?).
- We are looking for user testers in the future, we were wondering if it anyone from the shadow team or the tutors would be interested in partaking in our user testing. And if it would be done in tutorial time or outside of that time.
- We might also show some front-end stuff and get some feedback on it. Just what it would be most useful in seeing and viewing the wiki for example as that is what I am working on, at the moment.

## Content from the meeting

- There will be no tutorial on the 25/09/2024.
