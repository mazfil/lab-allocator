# Decision Log

We are keeping the decision log as a Google Sheets for ease of writing them out as the tabling structure of markdown is finicky, and it is easier to move things around in a google sheets form.

[Decision Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oskDGMkfkzdrmtNMLF5hAFBFKMAqcMn5JNsqAPCYPAM/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

Decisions sourced from Team Discussions, Team Meetings, Audits, cilent meetings and Actions made by the team.

Updated and kept as a log by Rachel Cao
