## Agenda:
Our first meeting is to develop an understanding of the team dynamic moving forward, losely asigning roles to understand how we will work together as a team and developing a Statement of Work.

## Content from the meeting
Today we generally discussed requirements for the Week 3 audit:
- Github readme submitted on the friday by the Spokespeople for the landing page subission.
- Statement of Work prepared, uploaded and signed by all parties prior to 9am 04/03/24

### Approaches to Development
Potential solutions to the project could include genetic algorithms or similar.
Information regarding genetic algorithms used in similar contexts:
- [A Utilization-based Genetic Algorithm for Solving the University Timetabling Problem (UGA)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110016816000703)
- [A solution to the university course timetabling problem using a hybrid method based on genetic algorithms](https://www.redalyc.org/journal/496/49668129006/html/)
- [TIME TABLE SCHEDULING USING GENETIC ALGORITHM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBbreqLVIzo&feature=youtu.be)


Majority of team members have a good understanding of Java. C is another potential language that could be used. Python may be beneficial if we are looking at ML Models. Developing something such as a webapp will involve HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Microsoft Sharepoint may possibly be integrated into the service, especially when considering a thorough user interface however this would need more research and understanding.

### Project Objectives and SoW info
We're looking to achieve
- **Efficiency**: To develop a system capable of creating the most efficient lab schedules, maximizing the use of available resources.
- **Flexibility**: To accommodate a wide range of constraints and course requirements, ensuring the system's applicability across various teaching periods and evolving academic needs.
- **Usability**: To provide a user-friendly interface that allows staff to input constraints, view schedules, and make adjustments as needed.
- **Scalability**: To ensure the system can handle an increasing number of courses, labs, and constraints without a decrease in performance.

### Loose Role Schedule.Allocation
|Student|Role(s)|
|-------|-------|
|Filip|(Frontend / UIUX Design / Project Manager / Admin / Testing) / Spokesperson|
|Sineeha|(Frontend / Database / Backend*) / Deputy Spokesperson|

### How the team will progress with work
Generally we will be using Github to track and assign issues between the team. At the current time with administrative tasks, we will assign issues as they need to be completed and close issues as they are completed.
