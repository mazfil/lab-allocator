*Meeting Minutes by Edward, Alex*

## Attendance (5/7):

- [X] Alex Boxall
- [ ] Hexuan Meng
- [ ] Filip Mazur
- [X] Edward Nivison
- [X] Rachel Cao
- [X] Sineeha Kodwani
- [X] Matthew Cawley

## Agenda:

- Go over again the audit requirements, in particular the criteria that we will be marked on.
- Make sure that we have a working demo that we can present reliably on the day.
- Recap what happened for the user testing.
- Matthew could perhaps go through his implementation of the MongoDB database on the VM.
- Recap for the other team members what is happening with the VM on campus.
- Detail out what we should be doing for this week.
- Reminder that we should be communicating on Github and use teams as a method of gaining peoples attention a bit quicker. And for asking non-trivial questions, but if it is something important to the project, you should be reciting it in the github issue that it is relevant to. This includes if it is a decision or a reflection.

## Content from the meeting

- Audit plan
  - Go through everything on the GitHub
    - Outputs, decision making, output, stakeholder engagement, team work, reflection
  - Technical outputs
    - Have screenshots of the system, user testing, the source code
    - Server
  - We seem to have everything we need, we just need to make sure we hit those points
  - Outputs
    - Should try to do a demonstration of the system running during the audit
    - Edward has created an outputs folder on GitHub - makes it easier for people to find the major outputs
      - Should also be documented elsewhere, the folder is just for ease of showing at audits
    - Bit difficult to show the database setup on the server, would just show that it's installed unless we populate it with test data
    - Could show the diagram with the database structure
  - Decision log will be updated tonight
  - Teamwork
    - Can show issues on GitHub that have us talking to one another
    - Also have, e.g. meeting minutes and their attendance
  - Need to try to make sure all of our comms are on GitHub
  - Audit sesssion is 5:00-5:30pm Wednesday - also need to listen to shadow team as well
  - Who's doing what - should do what you've been working on the most
    - Edward: GitHub, client communications
    - Matthew: transition from Firebase to MongoDB, why we're switching 
    - Alex: backend intro to GA, future plans (documentation, user testing)
    - Sineeha: introduction, and front end
    - Hexuan: not here right now... fitness function?
    - Rachel: reflection log, teamwork
    - Filip: front end, user testing, etc.
  - Backend plans: user testing, MongoDB, documentation, implementation
  - Don't do any development on Wednesday - need Firebase to be usable for the demo so don't use the quota
  - Filip planning to go through and fix some bugs that we found on Friday - should be good for a demo
- Will need to make sure the backend and database are well documented so the facilities team are able to go in later and update things such as the fitness function, etc.
  - Do developer documentation in addition to user documentation - facilities team are developers so doesn't need to be too detailed
  - Also useful for a handover process if the project continues next year
- MongoDB format
  - We should try to keep the data format as similar as possible to how it's already set up in Firebase
  - Should reduce the amount of code that needs to be rewritten 
- User testing outcomes
  - Looked at different colour schemes 
  - Tooltips only where needed
  - Adding a link on each page that would link to a wiki page with a user guide
- Recap on VM
  - People working on database and backend have access to VM
  - Need to be on campus at the moment to access it - later on it can be made accessible from anywhere
  - Reverse proxy?
  - MongoDB has its own shell, `mongosh`
  - Backend and frontend are now running on the server, need to add details to GitHub issues
- Make sure we're updating the GitHub projects page - and ensure the roadmap is filled out!!
  - Make sure you add start and end dates to it
- Future backend work:
  - Matthew: backend testing
  - Alex: connecting backend to MongoDB
