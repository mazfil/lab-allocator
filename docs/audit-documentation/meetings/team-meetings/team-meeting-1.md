*Meeting Minutes by Edward Nivison, Alex Boxall*

## Attendance (6/7):

- [X] Alex Boxall
- [X] Hexuan Meng
- [X] Filip Mazur
- [X] Edward Nivison
- [X] Rachel Cao
- [] Sineeha Kodwani
- [X] Matthew Cawley

## Agenda:

- Talk over the audit next week
- Recap over the project as of now
- Layout a new SoW for this semester and get Belinda to review it.
- Ensure we all have a role that suits everyone and we have a shared workload.
- Perhaps review over administrative elements such as the roadmap, decision logs, reflection logs, etc.
- (personally) I would love to have a review of the whole program so we can all understand what each others section performs, how to understand their code, what we need from each section, and generally improve the clarification of the project with everyone so everyone can help out with what is needed at a time so it isn't heavily reliant on a single person or two, to do a task for a section.
- Building on the previous statement is updating our development documents, installation and setup documents, and more.
- Frontend
- Backend
- Statement of work
- Guides
- User testing
- Deadlines

All the above is from our communications in Teams by Edward Nivison.

## Content from the meeting

Lecture recap
  - First audit will be a silent audit - don't do a presentation anymore, we just give them our GitHub and landing page
  - Need to revise the content for this semester, and **reflections**
  - Equal contributions to everything
  - Use the shadow team for code reviews and testing
  - Do WPP as you go rather than at the end

Talk over the audit next week:
  - "Set or reset the scope for the semester" - try to get most of this done this meeting
  - Should:
    - set up tooling for development
    - start using GitHub projects more, or find an easier/better way of doing it
      - Clickup? - free
      - last semester had things scattered over multiple spots - GitHub projects could work but as long as we don't use anything else
  - Need to do:
    - Create a team charter
    - Create a statement of work (milestones, scheduling, deliverables, techincal and other constraints, resources, risks, costs) - needs to be signed by the client. Needs to show evidence of stakeholder analysis
      - Continuing teams need to review and revise from previous semester
      - Seems quite outdated - have a new scope - will look at the old one but write a new one
    - Detailed how to for working on the project (a process to follow so everything's been documented)
      - Include this in the statement of work
    - Update the audit landing page
    - Structure for reflections and decision logs
      - Using Google Sheets for now - all happy to stay with that
    - Adding tasks to GitHub projects

Backend/database:
  - Not required to use ANU authentication - is preferred though
    - They could provide us with snippets, etc. to help us with that
  - Migrating away from Firebase?
    - Would require a lot of rewriting on the front end - Firebase acts slightly differently from e.g. an SQL database - the parsing/file validation won't be able to be carried across
    - Backend shouldn't require too many changes

Frontend:
  - Finalise the data format with Belinda (the spreadsheet they input the data into)
  - Finalising the timetable management page (will try to get done by mid/end of week 4)
  - Will get more features/improvements from working with Belinda - can try to do this in week 5
  - See timeline section for more details
  - Need to have a non-technical user manual written for the front end

What to talk to Belinda about:
  - Getting a prototype to her, can you run this, can we help you get set up
  - Give her a demo
  - Statement of work signing
  - What new features are needed
  - Received any different communications from TechLauncher
  - When she needs to make the next semester timetime by so she can use it

Task allocation:
  - Filip
    - Write front end timeline/milestones on the statement of work
    - Clear up front end tasks on GitLab
 - Matthew
    - Work on statement of work
    - Work on backend cleanup of tasks, timeline, etc.
 - Alex
    - Work on backend cleanup of tasks, timeline, etc.
    - Documentation on how to set up the backend 
 - Edward
    - Clean up of landing page, documentation, SoW/charter
    - How to guide for doing work on this
 - Hexuan
    - Work on backend cleanup of tasks, timeline, etc.
 - Rachel
    - Decision logs, reflection logs, SoW

## Timeline
  - Week 2
    - Team charter
    - SoW (by Friday morning)
    - Landing page
    - Clean up GitHub issues
    - Reflection and decision logs
    - Communicate with ANU IT about server and database
  - Week 3
    - Clean up GitHub issues
    - Create documentation
  - Week 4
    - Look at getting database setup locally without Firebase (+ week 5)
  - Week 5
    - Client / user testing
    - User guide/manual, help tips, etc.
  - Week 6
    - Milestone: have a database running on an ANU server (can have fake data)
      - allows us to then write front and back end code for that database
      - having this before the break should be good
  - Midsem break until end of semseter
    - Testing the front end works with a database on ANU servers
    - Other misc. improvements

## Action items:
  - Create a team charter
  - Create a statement of work (ideally by Friday morning so Belinda can sign it by the end of the day)
  - Update the landing page
  - Create a process for how we should work on the project (e.g. what to write on GitHub, etc.)
  - Create a structure for the reflections and decision logs and fill them in
  - Clean up the repo - close all of the issues and recreate relevant ones, linking to the old issues
  - Update the documentation for setting up the back end and the front end
  - Getting a local database set up on a machine so we don't need to use Firebase

## Reflective things:
  - Had scattered information everywhere, didn't make the best use of GitHub projects. We need to be better at keeping all of our information in one place and up to date
  - Not good documentation for how to set up the project (all of the existing documentation is outdated). Makes it hard for other team members to get started working on it. Need to improve the documentation so everyone can work on it easily.
  - Need to stick to our agenda during the meetings - our meetings tend to jump all over the place. 

## Decisions:
  - New statement of work required
    - Old one is very outdated (created in week 3). Can look at the previous one for some guidance, but a lot of it will probably need to be rewritten.
  - Want to get the project to a usable state
    - Belinda wants a usable project to use by the end of the semester so she can start using it
  - Get database running on ANU server before week 6
    - Allows us to start writing front end and back end code for the server during the break
    
## Future Meetings

Client meeting is TBD at either:

Wednesday (31/07) 9:30am-10:45am
Wednesday (31/07) 4:00pm-4:30pm
Wednesday (31/07) 5:00pm-5:45pm
Friday (02/08) 10:00am-12:00pm

We are still in communication with the team and figuring out the best time slot to pick for the most attendance possible.
