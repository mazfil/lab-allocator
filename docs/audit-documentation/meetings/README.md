This is where we keep our meeting minutes, they follow a format that we have defined.

They serve a purpose of:

- Keeping the Meeting Minutes so we can reference them back
- Keeping images of physical work that we might do
- Keeping record of decisions made in the meetings
- Keeping attendance of who turns up to the meetings
- The agenda, content, and future meeting agenda.

Keeping meeting minutes is essential for clear workflow in the team and vital to the project moving smoothly.
