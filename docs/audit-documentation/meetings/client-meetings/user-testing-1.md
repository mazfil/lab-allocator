### User Testing in Week 6.

*To be completed on the 23/08/24*

Belinda, Filip, Edward, Alex

## Agenda
- User testing and colour schemes
- Going over the spreadsheet of data we'd received
- 
## Side-Agenda
- Could we ask what risks we have for the project, so we can write up a risk register. Should be easy enough to write out.

## Meeting Minutes
- Colour schemes
  - Belinda has taken a look at the colour schemes before the meeting
  - The plain black/gray one was not going to work
    - Doesn't let you match classes across the timetable because the colours are all the same
  - The pastels were the preferred one, but anything except for the single-coloured one would work
  - Will try to generate more of the pastel ones for next time
- Spreadsheet of data
  - May have accidentally deleted the course size data when pre-processing the data
  - Don't have lecture times / days yet
  - Convenors cannot request an exact lecture time, but can specify a window of days where it could be placed
  - By the time we generate the lab timetable, lecture times will be known
  - Next semester's data is currently with convenors at the moment - not due until September
  - Data we have right now is for the current semester
  - Currently has free text input for requirements, we should be able to give them a more structured input where its broken down more logically
    - Asking more direct questions should help with the more common requests
  - The Microsoft Form just gives you the spreadsheet directly from the responses
- User testing
  - We don't have documentation yet, so will do some testing to see how intuitive it is to use
  - Can have up to 3 lectures per week
  - Specify cohorts as number of cohorts
  - Need to start from 8am-8pm
  - 

Meeting minutes from Edward.
- We can remove the COMP from the course codes. but still keep the information if it is needed. Find some way doing that.
- When you are on the manage table or where you are editing the timetable, there should be a message say did you mean to save the timetable, because you lose your progress if you go to dashboard with a changed timetable.
- Add the possibility for a one off tutorial to be added.
- We are still with the attitude of having a "every week is the same" attitude.
- We would prefer to have a button to run the algorithm, rather than it running automatically.
- More refined detail on how the algorithm generates the calendar. Show the fitness function in an easy to view method, the rankings, and how the algorithms prioritises different schedules.
- If I want to move a bigger class from a big classroom to a smaller classroom, will it tell me if the room is too small for the class. And to have a warning that it won't fit, but to also have an override if you know that only smaller amount of students are actually turning up.
- Future meeting we need to be able to run in about 15 minutes.

User documentation:

Just a few tool tips for things that are a bit more confusing or if it doesn't make sense exactly what the button would do.
A wiki article would be the best thing to do. We should have FAQs, and the ability to search it. Hosted on the frontend? Add some buttons or help items on each page that will take you to the relevant page.

A possible video for first time users?? Not necessary but a nice to have.

Bugs found:
- on save button.
