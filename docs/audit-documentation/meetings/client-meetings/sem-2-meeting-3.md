## Minutes
- User testing
  - Been scheduled for Wednesday
  - Also doing testing with Lena today at 2pm
  - Further user testing next week too
  - Should only be minor tweaks that come out of the user testing
  - For Wednesday's testing
    - Be prepared to check that the resulting timetable looks like something that would be generated
  - Will clear all the data for each person we do the user testing with, so they can go through the whole lifecycle
- Next week's audit
  - Belinda has another TechLauncher team - Filip will coordinate with that team so we're back to back to Belinda doesn't need to stick around for as long
- Dropping "COMP"
  - Want that for everything, or just things here and there?
  - Doesn't matter too much - might just make it easier on crowded screens to just have the number
  - If it works fine with the "COMP" it can stay
  - May be able to fix before Lena sees it today, otherwise it would be on Wednesday
- Course data
  - Combined the two spreadsheets into the spreadsheet format that we had prepared
  - As long as we have an example/templete spreadsheet it should be fine
  - Lecture time format, day of the week (three letters), time and length as one column to ensure it doesn't take up too many columns
- Documentation
  - Server down right now, once back up should be able to see the Wiki
- Login / security
  - At this stage in the semester not sure if will be able to get this implemented in time
  - Could have just a one-password kind of page that just prevents students from logging into it, don't need full auth system
  - Would be something that if the project was continuing it could be something to be extended later on
  - Multiple people logged in at the same time with one acconut:
    - Could lead to data consistency issues
  - Adding a note that someone else is in it (doesn't need to explain who, but just that someone else is there)
  - Could have a message on the page that tells you how long since the most recent login
- Handover
  - Documentation on how to use it, the backend fitness function
  - Two levels of documentation: the user documentation and the developer documentation for the handover or for someone else to come into it
- Put the link to the Wiki in the Teams chat / email
