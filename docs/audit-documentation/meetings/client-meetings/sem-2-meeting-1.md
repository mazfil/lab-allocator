- Semester 1 2025 timetable for the school of computing is due mid-August (a few weeks)
  - Get information about classes in August
  - Could use the data for that semester as a trial for how the system works
  - Things do change in between - can't finalise until lecture times are decided on
    - Some tutorials may have to move to avoid lectures
  - Draft timetable with central timetabling isn't due until Decemeber
- By mid-August we wouldn't have a complete set up without us needing to use the system
  - Can be provided with the data for that
  - Data would all be provisional and not to be shared (although a lot of it can probably be guessed)
  - Can probably get data provided around late-August
    - Fits in with schedule having user testing being in weeks 5/6
- Convenors have a separate form which they can fill out for when for personal/caring reasons cannot teach at certain times, we don't have access to this for privacy reasons
  - Doesn't normally matter for tutorial scheduling
- 27 teaching instances (e.g. COMP1100/COMP1130 are the same teaching instance) - will be less than this to schedule as they don't all do labs
  - Probably around 15 of them need computer labs
- About ~6000 individual students
- Admin team contacts - same as last semester
- Statement of work
  - Success critiera
    - Creating some documentation so it can used / worked on / updated in the future, etc. easily
    - Both set up documentation, and e.g. user manuals
    - Also document any limitations/restrictions with it so they know what the restrictions are and what can be expected of the system
- Getting a prototype to Belinda
  - Going to try to get a usable version by week 6
  - Will be using Firebase still by then - from the teaching break onwards will try to move it to ANU server
  - Have restrictions on software installed on ANU machines - can organise with SoCo a computer where it can be installed
- Audit questions are very targetted to what has been delivered so far (even when that is not expected of a team)
  - This semester should be much easier to deliver something by week 3
  - Should think about what can be delivered by then, e.g. a demo
- Running a demo
- Meeting times
  - Our team meetings will be 9-11am each Mondays
  - Belinda to join 10am
    - Will sometimes need to be online if not on campus
    - May only need to be a short meeting depending on what's going on that week
- Additional component of the fitness function to add: trying to run multiple classes of the same code at the same time - helps with cancelling classes with low attendance
- A minute is an acceptable time for the program to run in - 10-15 minutes is too long, up to 3-5 is probably acecptable
- Can add feature of locking class in place and then allowing it to re-run the algorithm afterwards - useful if a lot of manual rearrangements need to happen
- Colouring the courses would be useful - try to find a palette that isn't so overwhelming
  - We can give Belinda screenshots that she can then send to admin to see if they think it's useful or not
  - Can give example of the bright coloured one, or a muted gradients one, etc.
- Feedback on backend algorithm
  - Belinda can check who can take a look at schedules to see if the ones we are generating are reasonable
  - Can also compare to current or next semester's actual lab allocation
- Thursday 1pm-2pm
  - Only applies to convenors, so student classes still can and do run at this time - might be less though
