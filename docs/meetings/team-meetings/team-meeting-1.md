Our first meeting is to develop an understanding of the team dynamic moving forward, losely asigning roles to understand how we will work together as a team and developing a Statement of Work.

## Content from the meeting
Today we generally discussed requirements for the Week 3 audit:
- Github readme submitted on the friday by the Spokespeople for the landing page subission.
- Statement of Work prepared, uploaded and signed by all parties prior to 9am 04/03/24

### Approaches to Development
Potential solutions to the project could include genetic algorithms or similar.
Information regarding genetic algorithms used in similar contexts:
- [A Utilization-based Genetic Algorithm for Solving the University Timetabling Problem (UGA)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110016816000703)
- [A solution to the university course timetabling problem using a hybrid method based on genetic algorithms](https://www.redalyc.org/journal/496/49668129006/html/)
- [TIME TABLE SCHEDULING USING GENETIC ALGORITHM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBbreqLVIzo&feature=youtu.be)


Majority of team members have a good understanding of Java. C is another potential language that could be used. Python may be beneficial if we are looking at ML Models. Developing something such as a webapp will involve HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Microsoft Sharepoint may possibly be integrated into the service, especially when considering a thorough user interface however this would need more research and understanding.

### Project Objectives and SoW info
We're looking to achieve
- **Efficiency**: To develop a system capable of creating the most efficient lab schedules, maximizing the use of available resources.
- **Flexibility**: To accommodate a wide range of constraints and course requirements, ensuring the system's applicability across various teaching periods and evolving academic needs.
- **Usability**: To provide a user-friendly interface that allows staff to input constraints, view schedules, and make adjustments as needed.
- **Scalability**: To ensure the system can handle an increasing number of courses, labs, and constraints without a decrease in performance.

### Loose Role Allocation
|Student|Role(s)|
|-------|-------|
|Filip|(Frontend / UIUX Design / Project Manager / Admin / Testing) / Spokesperson|
|Sineeha|(Frontend / Database / Backend*) / Deputy Spokesperson|
|Edward|Project manager / (Frontend / Backend* / GitHub / Database / Testing)|
|Alex|Backend|
|Matthew|Developer|
|Rachel|Backend / Admin|
