| Reviewing of Pull Requests | ![DECIDED](https://dummyimage.com/150x35/4caf50/000000&text=++DECIDED) | Project Team | We have laid out the conditions and best practices for the request and merging of pull requests from branch to branch. 1. is to use branches to keep working code on a higher branch than the dev branch. 2. Have multiple reviewers review the pull request before merge 3. Make sure commits are properly named, have supporting documentation and appropriate commenting on any new additions (or respective changes to previous comments if majorly affected). | 20/03/2024 | Alex Boxall, Edward Nivison, Hexuan Meng |
