# Problematisation Analysis

## Initial client's brief
Aim: to create a resource allocation application for SoCo computer labs. The app must maximize resource utilization while adhering to a set of predefined constraints and provide a way to see flow-on affects if one booking is moved.

## Personal
### Who is the Client?
Belinda Bergin, Education Project Officer at the School of Computing, Australian National University.
### What motivates the Client?
The need to optimize the allocation of teaching activity locations requiring computer labs, a process that is currently time-consuming and requires significant problem-solving.

## Organisational
### What is the current operation of the business like?
The School of Computing at the Australian National University is facing inefficiencies in lab resource allocation. The process of assigning computer labs for teaching activities is time-consuming and requires significant problem-solving due to the challenge of matching lab sizes with tutorial sizes, leading to suboptimal space utilization.

## Current Operation
### What is currently working?
The existing process, though manual and time-consuming, is capable of allocating lab resources for teaching activities, ensuring that classes are scheduled with available resources.
### What are the strengths of the business?
The commitment to addressing scheduling inefficiencies and the recognition of the need for a system to optimize lab resource allocation demonstrate a proactive approach to improving operational efficiency.
### What are current weaknesses?
The manual scheduling process is inefficient, requiring significant effort and time, and often results in suboptimal use of resources.
### What can be improved?
The development of an automated, intelligent system can streamline the scheduling process, enhance resource utilization, and provide flexibility in handling varying needs and constraints.

## Environmental
### What environment do they operate in? What sector?
They operate in the higher education sector. This environment is characterized by the need for efficient scheduling and utilization of resources such as computer labs for teaching and research purposes.
### What are relevant statistics? What are the trends?
The trends in the higher education sector include increasing enrollment, growing demand for technology-enhanced learning spaces, and the need for efficient resource management to accommodate these changes.
### What are others doing in this space?
Universities and educational institutions are increasingly adopting digital solutions and automated systems for resource scheduling and allocation to improve efficiency, reduce administrative burden, and enhance the learning experience.

## Customers/Users
### Who do they currently see as their users/customer segments?
The primary users are the staff responsible for scheduling and coordinating lab resources within the School of Computing, faculty members requiring lab spaces for teaching, and students who utilize these labs for their coursework.
### Are there other customer segments? Who are they? What drives them?
Potential segments could include other departments within the university that face similar scheduling challenges, external educational institutions seeking efficient scheduling solutions, and software vendors interested in developing or integrating scheduling systems. These segments are driven by the need for efficient resource management, enhanced operational efficiency, and improved educational delivery.

## Value Proposition
### What is/do they think is their current value proposition?
The current value proposition centers on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of lab resource allocation within the School of Computing. They aim to offer a solution that streamlines the scheduling process, reduces administrative burden, and maximizes the utilization of lab resources, thereby enhancing the educational experience for faculty and students alike. This proposition underscores the commitment to leveraging technology to solve operational inefficiencies, ultimately benefiting the internal stakeholders of the School of Computing.

## Gap/Opportunities
### What is the ‘Gap’/‘Perceived Gap’?
The gap is between the current manual and time-consuming scheduling process and the potential for an efficient, automated system that optimally allocates lab resources.
### What do you see as the gap? What does the client see as the gap?
Both the client and the project team likely see the gap as the inefficiency in current scheduling practices that result in suboptimal utilization of resources and increased administrative burden.
### What opportunities does this create?
This gap presents the opportunity to develop a system that not only streamlines scheduling and maximizes resource utilization but also potentially serves as a benchmark for similar scheduling challenges within other departments or institutions.

## Redefined problem statement
To design and implement an intelligent lab resource allocation system that maximizes the utilization of computer labs within the School of Computing at the Australian National University by automating scheduling processes, addressing the inefficiencies of manual allocation, and ensuring optimal use of resources in alignment with the diverse needs of courses and student numbers.
